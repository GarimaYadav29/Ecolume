🙋‍♀️ About the Creator

Hi, I’m Garima Yadav, a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) student at Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University and a passionate developer with a strong interest in health, nutrition, fitness, and tech for good.

As someone who cares deeply about making healthy living accessible, I often noticed how confusing food labels can be — especially for people unfamiliar with nutritional terms. That’s what inspired Ecolume: to simplify nutritional awareness using barcode scanning and encourage eco-conscious behavior through carbon footprint tracking.

This project reflects my drive to build tools that not only use the MERN stack but also positively impact people’s lives. I aim to create solutions that are simple, meaningful, and inclusive — especially for those who may not have technical or nutritional knowledge.
